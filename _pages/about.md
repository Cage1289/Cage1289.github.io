A seasoned cybersecurity engineer with a passion for crafting innovative solutions and optimizing processes, I bring extensive experience in cloud engineering and code-sign security to the table. My expertise lies in developing, automating, and implementing robust secure software and procedures, ensuring swift and effective solutions are shaped to address complex real-world problems. As a skilled professional with a keen analytical mind, I'm well-versed in IT skills and technologies, utilizing them to form scalable frameworks. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in IT at UTS to further hone my skills and propel my career towards shaping the future of computer systems.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
